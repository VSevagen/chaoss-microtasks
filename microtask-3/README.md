1. What is the meaning of the JSON attribute <code>author_id</code> ? <br><br>
   <code>author_id</code> is one of the identifiers provided by SortingHat. Each profile fetched from SortingHat can have 1 or more identities. Each identity will have an id which will be unique.

   ```
   "author_id":"7e51a959bcd70ff8a179d8db3ff9b3c9964b8269","author_uuid":"7e51a959bcd70ff8a179d8db3ff9b3c9964b8269","author_user_name":"valeriocos","author_domain":"bitergia.com"

2. What is the meaning of the JSON attribute <code>author_org_name</code> ?<br><br>
   <code>author_org_name</code> refers to the organisation that the individual is currently enrolled in.
   Example: <code>'author_org_name': "Bitergia",</code>

<br><br>

3. What is the meaning of the JSON attribute <code>author_uuid</code> ?<br><br>
   Every author will have a unique id, <code>author_uuid</code> It might seem similar to <code>author_id</code> but in the case where we have to count number of authors, <code>author_uuid</code> is used.

```
FIELD_COUNT = 'author_uuid'  # field used to count Authors
```

- The reason being that uuid refers to the actual profile of an author, while id refers to an identity. A profile can have several identities but each profile is unique.

        profile = {}

        u = self.get_unique_identity(uuid)
        if u.profile:
            profile['name'] = u.profile.name
            profile['email'] = u.profile.email
            profile['gender'] = u.profile.gender
            profile['gender_acc'] = u.profile.gender_acc

        return profile
```
